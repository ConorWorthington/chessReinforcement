# chessReinforcement
A model which attempts to train an LTSM based model how to evaluate chess boards and subsequently play chess from stockfish.
This model produces the training data in real time from games it plays itself. The code is easy to modify.
An example of the program in action can be seen at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XYYhzXdk9E&ab_channel=battlebirtie
